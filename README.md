# Problem Solving - LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode problem-solving repository, where I showcase my solutions to various coding problems sourced from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).

## Repository Structure and Naming Convention

I've organized the repository by categorizing problems into sets, such as Arrays, Strings, Trees, etc. My approach to naming and categorizing problems is as follows:

1. Each problem solution is categorized and stored based on its type.
2. Naming Format:
   - Solved Problems: `<problem number>_<problem name with underscores>.<ext>`
   - Duplicate Solutions: If solved more than once, consecutive solutions are named as `<problem number>_<problem name with underscores>_<2/3/4/...>.<ext>`
   - Unsolved Problems: For unsolved problems, I append `-todo` to the filename, `<problem number>_<problem name with underscores>-todo.<ext>`

## Running the Solutions

- Python Solutions: Python scripts are provided for most problems. You can execute them using Python 3.x.
- Database Problems: For database problems, solutions can be directly run in the LeetCode Problem Explorer.

## Repository Insights

To provide an overview of the locally organized problems, I've created a Python script, [leetcode_statistics.py](/leetcode_statistics.py), which calculates and displays statistics of organized problems in the repository, shown below,
